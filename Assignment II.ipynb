    "\n",
    "1. **Student Grades Dictionary:**\n",
    "   - Create a dictionary to store student names as keys and their grades as values. Write a function to update a student's grade and another function to calculate the average grade of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inventory Management:**\n",
    "   - You run a small store and have a dictionary where the keys are product names and the values are quantities. Write a function to update the quantity of a product after a sale and another to add a new product to the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Phonebook Application:**\n",
    "   - Create a phonebook application where the names of your contacts are keys and their phone numbers are values. Write functions to add a new contact, update an existing contact’s phone number, and search for a contact by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Library System:**\n",
    "   - You are managing a small library. Create a dictionary where the keys are book titles and the values are the number of copies available. Write a function to lend a book (decrease the count) and another to return a book (increase the count).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Currency Conversion:**\n",

    "\n",
    "7. **Employee Salary Management:**\n",
    "   - Create a dictionary with employee names as keys and their salaries as values. Write a function to give a percentage raise to all employees and another to calculate the total payroll of the company.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Traffic Light System:**\n",
    "   - Write a function that simulates a traffic light system, where the light can be either \"red\", \"yellow\", or \"green\". The function should return `True` if it's safe to cross the road (i.e., when the light is green) and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Login System:**\n",
    "   - Implement a login system where you check if the entered username and password match the stored values. The function should return `True` if the login is successful and `False` if not.\n",
    "\n",
